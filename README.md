<b>To Do Task</b> 

The challenge of this project was to adjust the starting code of HTML and CSS by adding in Bootstrap and jQuery. Experience creating a modal that would create a task and change color depending on how close it is to set date. Lastly, be able to drag each card for the status of the task.  

This challenge was great to be able to see how jQuery can shorten the amount of code that can be written. Some parts were a struggle trying to figure out and others were pretty smooth but wanted to continue the practice of JavaScript and jQuery.
